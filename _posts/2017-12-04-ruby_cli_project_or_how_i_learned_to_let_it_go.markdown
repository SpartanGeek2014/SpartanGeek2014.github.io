I'm a virgo. Ergo, supposedly, a perfectionist by nature.
I don't use that as an excuse, but I do occasionally use it as a defense.  For this project, I am most definitely breaking it out and holding it up as a shield to ward off any bashing I'll potentially take.  

I am learning to love coding. It's challenging. It requires a lot more creativity, than I normally employ in my daily life. And, when you get to the end and it all actually works---it's very fun!

This project was especially challenging, as I had no codealong, as so many of the other projects had accompanying them.  It was all on my own and I had to figure out the various scraping parameters by myself.  All in all, I started to doubt my abilities. Every time I tried to run a test, I'd get an error message.  Every time I added more code, I'd get a 'nomethod' error message, and had to figure out why one thing wasn't connecting to another.  To say it was frustrating, would be a disservice to the true meaning of the word.

But then, as with most things we learn, it started to come together.  One by one, the lines of code in my scraper file were pulling the info I wanted and the cli file was printing them in the format I wanted.  It immediately boosted my confidence. As I added more detail to the project, I became more convinced I was on the right track.  So much so, that I started to doubt myself, as I felt it should be more "robust", than it was then.  That was when I got to the end of Avi's video, and he said the one thing I wasn't expecting, which was, "...that will be enough to pass this project.."

Yes, I flabbergasted, blown away, and my chin was probably further across the room then it had ever been before, during a period of flabbergastion and blown awayedness (if there is such a thing).  I felt relief, because I knew then that I had a working Ruby Gem and could turn it in.  However, I also felt like I missed out on something, because, as I said earlier, I wanted my "now-playing" Gem to be able to pull a lot more movie info than it does.  I don't know, but I'm not going to hold on to that feeling and blow a grade. I'm letting it go.  I'm turning it in and seeing where the road leads to next on this coding journey I'm on.
