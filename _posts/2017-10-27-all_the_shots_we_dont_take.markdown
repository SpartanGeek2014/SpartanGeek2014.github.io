I'm not a big believer in karma.  Nor am I a huge believer in destiny.  I am, however, a big believer in each of us affecting the outcome of our individual futures, based on the decisions we make and/or the chances we take in life.  

For the longest time, I avoided trying to do all I could to further my ambitions and dreams of becoming a software...anything. I would convince myself that I didn't have the education, experience, energy, or natural ability to work in the industry.  What I've come to know is that none of those was ever a factor.  It was always my personal motivation and drive to overcome those perceived obstacles that got in my way.  I literally was my career's own worst enemy.

Thankfully, what I have always been able to do is learn.  I learn from my successes, but I most definitely learn from my failures, too.  When I discovered that it was possible to join a reputable programming school, like Flatiron, and still be able to work and provide for my family, that completely left me without any excuses that I could justify for not enrolling and getting myself on the road to living my software engineering dreams.

I've been following through and pushing myself to complete the Online Community Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp as quickly and well as I possibly can.  I'm putting dating, movies, and other curricular activities on hold to make sure I crank out the reading, coding, and debugging as quickly as I can.  No, I'm not neglecting my daughter or my personal health needs.  I spend as much time with her as life allows and I work out 5 to 6 mornings of every week.  It's just that now that I have elminated my ability to procrastinate, I am blasting through these mini-barriers (i.e., Python, Ruby, SQL, JavaScript, etc.) and on to bigger and better things.

The title of my blog entry is based on the famous quote from hockey legend, Wayne Gretzky, who once was quoted as saying, "In life, we miss one hundred percent of the all the shots we don't take."  Thanks to Flatiron School, software engineering and a happier more fullfilling life are not a shot I won't take any longer.
